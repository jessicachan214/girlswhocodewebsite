    BIO: Hi, everyone! I am a Chinese girl from San Francisco, California.
    I will be in 11th grade in the fall at Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory.
    On my free time, I like drawing, hanging with my friends, and shopping. I enjoy going to school and my favorite class is mathematics.
    </p>
    <h2> Drawing </h2>
    <p>
    One of my hobbies is drawing. When I draw, it allows me to use my imagination and be creative. It makes me calm and is a kind of meditation to me.
    I draw whenever I can and I really love doing it.
    Here are a few of my illustrations from the past years. Enjoy, my peeps!

    <h2>My Family</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
    My friends are my family. They always make me laugh and they lift my spirits up whenever I see them. They are constantly there
    for me through the ups and downs. Although I can be a big nuisance, they listen to my rants and the crap in my life.
    I love them more than words can describe.
